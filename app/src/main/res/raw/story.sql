INSERT INTO "story" VALUES('63','What Is a Naked Mole Rat?','Do not be fooled by the strange appearance and silly name.  A naked mole rat is a very interesting animal with a pink, wrinkly, hairless body that looks like a small walrus. It digs burrows underground like moles.  Why are they naked?  They only live in areas where it is warm and they don''t need hair to keep them warm.  Also, because they live underground, they don''t need hair to protect their skin from the sun. If they get cold, they huddle together in a pile creating enough body heat to keep them warm. Naked mole rats like to live in large groups in underground tunnels called colonies, just like ants and bees.  There can be close to 100 mole rats living in each colony. They live together in communities led by one queen rat.  Just like ants and bees, the other mole rats have jobs as well.  The worker rats are responsible for hunting for food, digging tunnels and taking care of the queen''s babies, called pups.  The soldier rats help protect the colony from predators and defend their colony with their sharp teeth.  One way they defend their colony when they are attacked by predators is to lie on top of each other in the tunnel, blocking the path to the queen and using their sharp teeth to stop their enemy.

INSERT INTO "story" VALUES('64','A Snake That Eats Eggs','Can you imagine if you had to eat raw eggs for the rest of your life? Even worse, can you imagine eating the eggs while they were still in their shells? That is exactly what the African egg-eating snake does. Eating a bird''s egg whole would be very difficult. In order to do this, the snake''s jaws, mouth and throat open wide enough for the egg. The toothless snake puts its mouth around the egg, pushes it down its throat and cracks the egg on the bony bumps along its spine.  This opens the egg, the yolk runs down and the snake spits out the shell. That seems like a lot of work for one meal!','story_64.jpg','0');
INSERT INTO "story" VALUES('65','Inside the Life of a Blue Whale','The blue whale is known as the largest mammal in the world. It can grow to over 100 feet long and weighs almost 200 tons. Their tongues can weigh as much as an elephant and their hearts can weigh as much as a car! Amazingly, these enormous creatures only eat krill, tiny shrimp-like animals that live in the ocean. Krill are so tiny that a blue whale will need to eat least 4 tons of krill daily just to survive. Blue whales are a type of baleen whale.  Instead of teeth, baleen whales have fringed plates that look like fingernails attached to their upper jaws.  The whale gulps in large amounts of water, expanding the skin in its throat and stomach to make room for it.  Then its huge tongue pushes the water back out through the baleen, capturing thousands of krill left behind. Blue whales can live to be 80 to 90 years old.  The oldest whale that has been found was 110 years old.  That whale must have eaten a lot of krill in its lifetime! ','story_65.jpg','0');

Male seahorses have a small pouch on the front, a bit like a kangaroo pouch. The female seahorses lay their eggs in the pouch and the males carry them around for 9 to 45 days until they hatch. Then the baby seahorses come out of the pouch begin to explore on their own. Male seahorses carry up to 1,500 eggs in their pouch. ','story_66.jpg','0');
INSERT INTO "story" VALUES('67','Hibernating Bears','You may have heard that bears like to sleep in the winter. This is true! Black bears and grizzly bears curl up in their dens and go into a deep sleep.  They are hibernating through the winter. The only exception is female bears, which wake up in January or February to give birth to their young cubs. They stay alive without eating all winter because they can use all that fat they have stored by eating in the spring, summer and fall. Hibernating bears do not breathe very often, and their hearts beat very slowly. Because food is hard to find in the winter, it is best for them to sleep through the winter.  They can sleep for up to 7 months and once spring arrives, the bears will come out of their dens.  As you can imagine, they will be very hungry! ','story_67.jpg','0');
INSERT INTO "story" VALUES('68','Nature''s Way of Protecting Animals','When it is cold outside, people reach for a warm coat to wear. Animals need to stay warm to survive just like we do. The muskrat is an animal that has special protection from the weather.  They have an extra layer of thick fur that helps to keep them warm when swimming through the cool waters. Water rolls right off the fur, letting the animal stay dry and warm. Mammals like whales have a thick layer of fat, called blubber, to help keep them warm in the cold Arctic Ocean. Birds are covered in feathers, so that the drops of water roll right off them. These animals have special features that make it almost like wearing a raincoat!','story_68.jpg','0');

They can do it to protect themselves, have fun or to find a mate. Some animals also spit when they are mad or even to catch their dinner. Animals like llamas and camels spit stomach juice when they are upset. Cobras spit venom to protect themselves. Fish called Archerfish wait on the surface of the water to spit on bugs sitting on a plant to catch them for their dinner.  There are also bugs called spittle bugs that like to spit. They squirt spit on themselves to stay warm or to keep cool. Spitting can help many animals to survive.','story_69.jpg','0');

This means that spend part of their life in the water, and the rest of their life on land.  It is very interesting to learn about the life cycle of the frog. Frogs lay their eggs in the water.  After the eggs hatch, they become tadpoles. Tadpoles still don''t look like frogs. They have a tail and gills which help them breathe while swimming in the water like a fish. As the tadpole grows, it develops hind legs and then front legs.  After a while, its tail and gills disappear. After fully developing, frogs live on land and in the water. Frogs can be found everywhere in the world except in Antarctica.  They prefer homes that are warm.  Did you know that frogs were so interesting? ','story_70.jpg','0');
